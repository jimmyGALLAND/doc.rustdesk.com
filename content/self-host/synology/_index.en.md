- Mount a host directory (e.g. `Shared/test/`) to `/root`, hbbs will generate some files (including the `key` file) in this directory

- Set command
{{% notice note %}}
synology's OS is Debian based, so host net (--net=host) works fine, we do not need to map ports with `-p` option.

`192.168.16.98` is an intranet ip used here for demonstration only, please set it to a public ip when you deploy.
